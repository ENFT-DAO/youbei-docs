# Getting Verified

Getting verified is another most requested feature from creators of the community. In order to make the process smoother, we decided to implement a set of requirements and pinpoint them, so it is open and clear to everyone what the steps are and what the creators have to do in order to have their collection verified.

There are two ways for a collection to be verified:

1. Mint your Collection using Erdsea (see Platform minting section)
2. Creator has to pay an initial fee of 2.5EGLD and there needs to be at least: 100TXs and 100EGLD traded for tokens in the collection.

This fee model aims to simplify the steps by using the already available requirements as for \[Platform Minting]. A collection that was minted using Erdsea is by default verified. Other collections that do not choose the minting feature can also get verified, but they have to pay the initial 2.5EGLD. We think that this is fair on both sides (collection being minted using Erdsea and minted outside) by having the same fixed base fee.

A verified Creator has to have at least a verified Collection.
