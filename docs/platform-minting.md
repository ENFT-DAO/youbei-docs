# Platform Minting

Pigselated launch went perfectly. As it is the Premier NFT collection on Erdsea, it benefited from having platform support for minting. The whole process went extremely smooth and the community welcomed it. Afterward, this feature was heavily requested by creators and we decided to offer this as a service.

In order to do this creators have to mint their collection using the Deployer Contract. This step is mandatory and required in order to be sure of the integrity of the tokens being minted using Erdsea directly.

Several additional steps have to be performed by the Erdsea Team including: manually sorting and filtering of creators, checking if all requirements are met in order for the creator to be able to Deploy a Minter Contract, manually setting up all the information needed for minting and so on.

Because of this, we decided to add a small fee to the service, to keep things balanced. The fees are in the form of an initial fixed fee of 2.5EGLD + 1.5% fee per minted token.

This fee model aims to give the opportunity to the vast majority of creators to take part by allowing them to benefit from the service having available a relatively small initial capital.

Minting fee is applied only to the tokens minted using the platform. The creator can also have its own minting process at the same time. For those tokens minted outside the platform, Erdsea will not apply any fees.
